    <string name="large_text">A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning
        environments for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems
        of formal education, which is commonly compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools.
        The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include primary
        school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where
        higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university, but these higher education
        institutions are usually not compulsory.

In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary
        (Elementary in the US) and secondary (Middle school in the US) education. Kindergarten or preschool provide some
        schooling to very young children (typically ages 3â€“5). University, vocational school, college or seminary may be
        available after secondary school. A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics
        or a school of dance. Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.

There are also non-government schools, called private schools. Private schools [3] may be required when the government
        does not supply adequate, or special education. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian
        schools, madrasa, hawzas (Shi a schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher
        standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults include institutions
        of corporate training, military education and training and business schools.

In home schooling and online schools, teaching and learning take place outside a traditional school building.
        Schools are commonly organized in several different organizational models, including departmental, small learning
        communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school.
